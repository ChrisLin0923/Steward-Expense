/**
 * By adding /// <reference types="vite/client" />, you inform TypeScript about the types

 * and file types. CSS Module Types: Vite supports CSS Modules out of the box, but TypeScript
 * needs to know how to interpret these files. If you didnâ€™t have the proper type definitions,
 * TypeScript may not recognize imports from .module.css files, leading to errors.
